# Azure Bootcamp 25th April #

## How MS present Azure - The Cloud for Modern Business ##

Why the cloud?
1.  Speed
2.  Scale
3.  Economics

Pizza as a service example:

Hosting Models
- On prem (Pizza made at home)
- Infrastructure as a service (Bake at home)
- Platform as a service (Take away)
Business Models
- SAAS (Eat out)

Azure footprint - 19 regions (as of April 2015)

Datacenters owned and operated by MS. 

Azure SQL Scale Out
https://www.pottermore.com/

Used PAAS. Had 160million requests in 24h.  SQL as a service. Web roles for site and set to autoscale.  

Monthly SLA

- Offer SLA on different services, look at SLA for service when comparing. 


## Virtual Machines ##

Getting started:
- Management portal
- Scripting
- REST Api
	- Rest API docs have a date header, so you can go back to old APIs
- Comprehensive networking

Most people do command and control using powershell

- Select image size and VM, can upload your own vhd


## SQL Database ##

- SQL as a Service
- Fully managed
- Enterprise ready with automatic support for HA
- Elastic scale out
- Can scale based on DTUs
- Support for TDS and ODBC
- Cross datacenter failover and backups to support disaster recovery scenarios (see scott gu on channel 9)

## HDInsights (Hadoop) ##

## Azure ML ##

## App Service Web Apps (Azure Websites) ##

Can rollback versions

App service:
- Web Apps
- Mobile Apps
- Logic Apps
- API Apps

## Visual Studio - Application Insights ##

Application telemetary.
Now point and click.

VS Online has load testing

## Azure AD ##

## Media Services ##

## Internet of Things ##

- Event Hubs
- Notification Hubs
- Stream Analytics
- ML
- HDInsight

## Azure Data Factory ##

- Take files and put into Azure data sources

## Azure stream analytics ##

## Lab - Cloud Services  ##

Cloud Service - stateless no persisted storage.  
Can monitor end points.
Scaling control.
Linked resources - can link a resource and stop the cloud service being deleted if a database exists for example
Need to have packaged .net and configuration file.

## Building Cloud Solutions ##

Why use Azure:
Can move infrastructure as is, then migrate to PAAS.

-> Microsoft trying to solve problems of distributed computing.

Your Service
- Your application code
- Required resources

In the cloud:
- Automation
- Version environments
- Continuous Deployment

Cloud Services

Focus on application
Cloud responsible for scalability, availability, diagnostics
Choice of:
- VM (Server 2012 R2)
- Worker role has .Net installed
- Web role ASP.Net and IIS

Create endpoints (port forwarding)
- public endpoints
- internal endpoints
- instance input endpoints

Hosts:
- webforms or MVC
- FastCGI - php etc
- Multiple websites
- Http/s
- Web/worker hybrid

Worker role patterns
- Queue polling worker
- Listening worker role (WCF endpoint)
- External process worker role

Use tasks rather than write multithreading code.  Just say I have some work that needs doing.  

Think about other ways of dividing an writing code, e.g. orleans etc [https://github.com/dotnet/orleans ](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans "https://github.com/dotnet/orleans")

## Design for Cloud ##

As long as you have one server there were no issues, hardest step was from going from one to two - because of state management.

Cloud is not reliable - because services are distributed you need to embrace errors - most are still transient errors.  Eg. Getting access to the database - do I need to retry after a period of time? (Eg supported in EF6).

Sample architecture:

US West Website
SQL Azure
Azure AD
Service Bus
CDN
Cache

Azure Websites Git Deployment - source code:

## Redundancy in Azure
 ##

- Azure storage with replicas.
- SQL Database built-in backup servers
- Azure Caching wih HA
- Multi instance Azure WEbsites and Loud Services
- Load balanced virtual machines
- Virtual networks
- Traffic manager for failover

Power BI - alternative to SSRS 
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/powerbi/default.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/powerbi/default.aspx "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/powerbi/default.aspx")

## Reliability ##

- Auto recovery
- VIP Swap
- Fault domain
- VM Availability set

## What does failsafe mean for my applications? ##

- Take advantage of Azure features
- Avoid single point of failure
- Failure mode analysis
- Some errors are transient
- Graceful degredation 

- Use Service bus for communication between apps - already deals with with transient faults
